This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a business, helping to inform targeted retention strategies. Using a dataset with customer demographics, service usage, and payment information, I applied machine learning techniques to uncover patterns associated with customer churn. Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, standardized features, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed relationships between customer attributes and churn to identify significant features.
Modeling and Evaluation: Trained multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with Gradient Boosting achieving the highest accuracy (85%) and an F1 score of 0.82.
Feature Importance: Discovered that contract length, payment method, and monthly charges were strong indicators of churn.
The final model provides actionable insights to support customer retention efforts. This repository includes the code and steps taken to build, optimize, and evaluate the model.
